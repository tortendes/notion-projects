## On the topic of parameters
To set the parameters of the widget, add an ? and the parameter type, an equal sign, and the value. Like this:
`?key=key1038`

But, after that first parameter, any parameter after that should instead have an & in the end. Like this:
`?key=key1038&loc=New%20York`
### the %20 is just the url equivalent for space. since servers could only process certain characters, these are used as an replacement for them.

List of parameters
| Parameter | Key |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| API Key | `?key=<API_KEY>` |
| Location | `?loc=<YOUR_LOCATION>` |
| Scale *(optional)* | `?scale=<either_f_or_c_SHOULD_BE_LOWERCASE>` |

### In the topic of Celsius as default.
This widget uses the Celsius unit as the default temperature scale, in order to change it to Fahrenheit, you need to self-host this widget thru [Github](https://github.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), or other self hosting options, and change `response.current.temp_c` on the setWeather function to `response.current.temp_f` and change the `¬∞C` to `¬∞F`.
